### Notes
Some devices may not have all of the positions given in the screenshots. Please configure the settings that are similar or equal to the screenshots or if you are not sure, message me to add a Screenshot or TXT for your certain position.

You might hear distortion with some devices on the Normal Preset. This is due to some devices not being to able to handle the frequencies at higher volumes (more than 60% volume) compared to device tests. If this is the case, either lower your phone volume to 60% or less or use the Apple DAC folder preset.
