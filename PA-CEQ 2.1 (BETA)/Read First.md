## This PA-CEQ preset is in **beta**. It is subject to change depending on testing/review.

### Notes
Some Android, iOS, music apps, cars, etc. may not have all of the positions given in the screenshots. Please configure the settings that are similar or equal to the screenshots or if you are not sure, message me to add a Screenshot or TXT for your certain position.

Sometimes when using PA-CEQ, you might hear broken audio. If this is the case, use the Apple DAC folder preset as this fixes many issues with the audio. It turns out some devices struggle with high dB on lower frequencies than others. (It is named Apple DAC as this is mainly the device that struggled first before my own car)
