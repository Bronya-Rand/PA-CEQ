# PA-CEQ
Community Equalizer for Poweramp based off the Sennheiser HD598, Focal Utopia, Origaudio Lunatune, and cars with Bluetooth, Apple USB-C to 3.5mm Adapter with no DAC.

## What's PA-CEQ?
PA-CEQ or Poweramp Community Equalizer (I call it Focal Utopia Equalizer) is a community driven equalizer for PowerAmp which can also be applied to other devices and software like non-PowerAmp apps, iOS, Stock Android, and more tested on the Sennheiser HD598, Focal Utopia and Origaudio Lunatune with no USB DAC and with and a 3.5mm jack.

## Why make PA-CEQ? You do know this was answered a long time ago on the XDA forums.
Yes. I actually used that preset before making PA-CEQ but felt something off about it. Apart from some music sounding off, I prefered a non-bass and non-treble based preset and only a dB increase or decrease and that there wasn't a estimated dB range for that XDA post so it was up to a guess to determine the EQ if it was 11.X or 12.X for different ranges and what songs that person used. PA-CEQ is actually based on the same preset with some major dB and bass/treble changes.

## So what is different in PA-CEQ?
Ranges and tone. There is 0 reliance of Bass and Treble and are based off the dB equalizer in the app. Along with only dB reliance, a saved preset to transfer to other devices and visibility for other apps and OS's that don't have Poweramp or to Windows, and car radios.

## How do I install PA-CEQ?
- Option 1 [For PowerAmp Users]: Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/PA-CEQ/releases) and download the latest `last.poweramp-settings` file in there and drop it in the `Android/data/_com.maxmpz.audioplayer` folder. Please note this will reset your skin and any old presets if you have one or theme so please re-adjust that after install.
- Option 2 [Recommended]: Enter the `Preset Screenshots` folder in the specific PA-CEQ version of your choice and view the PA-CEQ screenshots in there and apply it to your device. Please read the `Read First.md` file in the folder before configuring.

Apart from messaging me on the PowerAmp forums or XDA, you can either fork this repository to your Github account, apply your settings and make a pull request or make a issue to this repository in the Issues Tab with your preset and it will be tested if there is a notice with the tested songs and your tested song.

There will be but I really suggest to use the non-bass version first to expierence it and songs without
