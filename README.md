# PA-CEQ
PA-CEQ or **P**ower**a**mp **C**ommunity **Eq**ualizer is a community driven equalizer for Poweramp, Poweramp Equalizer and other devices which that improves audio fidelity of songs.

## Why make PA-CEQ? You do know this was answered a long time ago on XDA.
Yes. I actually used that preset before making PA-CEQ but something felt off about it. I prefered a non-bass and non-treble based preset and only a dB increase or decrease and that there wasn't a estimated dB range for that XDA post so it was up to a guess to determine the EQ numbers. PA-CEQ is based on the same preset with some major dB and bass/treble changes.

## How do I install PA-CEQ?
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/PA-CEQ/releases) and download the latest ZIP file in there and select the version of PA-CEQ to use. Choose eithet the `Normal` or `Apple DAC` option and copy the equalizer prefix to Poweramp/your device.
> Please read the `Read First.md` file in the folder before configuring over the difference between *Normal* and *Apple DAC*.

## What is your testing method for this preset? 
Samsung Galaxy S9+ and Note 10+. 

Only DVC and Equalizer were used. No Dolby Atmos, Adapt Sound, Preamp, MusicFX, Balance, Bass, Tone, Limit and Treble at 60% Volume.

Headphones used are the Sennheiser HD598 and Focal Utopia. Additional testing with a Apple USB-C to 3.5mm Adapter and Origaudio Lunatune.

## Hey! I have a issue with your preset and found a better setting for it. How can I suggest it to you to apply it?
Apart from messaging me on the Poweramp forums or XDA, you can either fork this repository to your Github account, apply your settings and make a pull request or make a issue to this repository in the Issues Tab with your preset and it will be tested if there is a notice with the tested songs and your tested song.
