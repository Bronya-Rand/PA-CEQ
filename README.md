# PA-CEQ
PA-CEQ or **P**ower**a**mp **C**ommunity **Eq**ualizer is a community driven equalizer for Poweramp, Poweramp Equalizer (not a app) and other devices which that improves audio fidelity of songs.

> ### PA-CEQ 3.0 is out! Check it out now in the **[Releases](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/PA-CEQ/releases)** section!

## Why make PA-CEQ? You do know this was answered a long time ago on XDA.
Yes. I actually used that preset before making PA-CEQ but something felt off about it. I prefered a non-bass and non-treble based preset and there wasn't a estimated dB range for that preset long ago so it was up to a guess to determine the EQ numbers. PA-CEQ is based on the same preset with some major changes.

## How do I install PA-CEQ?
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/PA-CEQ/releases) and download the latest version of PA-CEQ.

For PA-CEQ 1.0 - 2.1:

2. Choose either the `Normal` or `Apple DAC` preset and copy the values to Poweramp, Poweramp Equalizer or your device.
> Please read the `Read First.md` file in the folder before configuring over the difference between *Normal* and *Apple DAC*.

For PA-CEQ 3.0 and above:

2. Copy the values within the screenshot to Poweramp or your device or import the preset files to Poweramp/Poweramp Equalizer.
> You may either use the screenshot in the PA-CEQ 3/3.01 folder or import it via the Poweramp Equalizer preset inside `For Poweramp Equalizer` (PA-CEQ 3) or `PA-CEQ 3 (Old)/For Poweramp Equalizer` (PA-CEQ 3.01). 

## What is your testing methodology? 
Devices: Samsung Galaxy S9+ & Note 10+.
