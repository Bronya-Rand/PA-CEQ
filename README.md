# PA-CEQ
PA-CEQ or Poweramp Community Equalizer is a community driven equalizer for Poweramp which can also be applied to other devices that improves audio fidelity which had been tested on the Sennheiser HD598, Focal Utopia and Origaudio Lunatune with no USB DAC, Bluetooth, a USB 3.5mm jack and a normal 3.5mm jack.

## Why make PA-CEQ? You do know this was answered a long time ago on the XDA forums.
Yes. I actually used that preset before making PA-CEQ but felt something off about it. Apart from some music sounding off, I prefered a non-bass and non-treble based preset and only a dB increase or decrease and that there wasn't a estimated dB range for that XDA post so it was up to a guess to determine the EQ if it was 11.X or 12.X for different ranges and what songs that person used. PA-CEQ is actually based on the same preset with some major dB and bass/treble changes.

## So what is different in PA-CEQ?
There is 0 reliance of bass and treble and are based off the dB equalizer in the app.

## How do I install PA-CEQ?
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/PA-CEQ/releases) and download the latest ZIP file in there and select the version of PA-CEQ to use. Choose eithet the Normal or Apple DAC option and copy the equalizer prefix to Poweramp/your device.
Please read the `Read First.md` file in the folder before configuring over the difference between Normal and Apple DAC.

## What is your testing method for this preset?

## Hey! I have a issue with your preset and found a better setting for it. How can I suggest it to you to apply it?
Apart from messaging me on the PowerAmp forums or XDA, you can either fork this repository to your Github account, apply your settings and make a pull request or make a issue to this repository in the Issues Tab with your preset and it will be tested if there is a notice with the tested songs and your tested song.

## Will there be a PA-CEQ Bass Enabled Preset.
There will be but I really suggest to use the non-bass version first to expierence it and songs without
