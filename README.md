# PA-CEQ
PA-CEQ or **P**ower**a**mp **C**ommunity **Eq**ualizer is a community driven equalizer for Poweramp, Poweramp Equalizer (not a app) and other devices which that improves audio fidelity of songs.

> ### **UPDATE:** PA-CEQ 3.0 is finally out! This is a major audio EQ revision which uses less gain but improves the music still despite it's subtle changes. Check it out now in the **[Releases](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/PA-CEQ)** section!

## Why make PA-CEQ? You do know this was answered a long time ago on XDA.
Yes. I actually used that preset before making PA-CEQ but something felt off about it. I prefered a non-bass and non-treble based preset and only a dB increase or decrease and that there wasn't a estimated dB range for that XDA post so it was up to a guess to determine the EQ numbers. PA-CEQ is based on the same preset with some major dB and bass/treble changes.

## How do I install PA-CEQ?
For PA-CEQ 1.0-2.1
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/PA-CEQ/releases) and download the latest ZIP file in there and select the version of PA-CEQ to use. 
2. Choose either the `Normal` or `Apple DAC` preset and copy the values to Poweramp, Poweramp Equalizer or your device.
> Please read the `Read First.md` file in the folder before configuring over the difference between *Normal* and *Apple DAC*.

For PA-CEQ 3.0 and above
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/PA-CEQ/releases) and download the latest ZIP file in there and select the version of PA-CEQ to use.
2. Copy the values within the screenshot to Poweramp or your device or import the equalizer file inside the `For Poweramp Equalizer` folder to Poweramp Equalizer.

## What is your testing methodology? 
Samsung Galaxy S9+, Note 10+ and Note 10+ in Dex Mode. Only DVC and Equalizer were used.

Headphones used are the Sennheiser HD598 and Focal Utopia. Additional testing with a Apple USB-C to 3.5mm Adapter, Origaudio Lunatune and Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Gen.

Dex Mode testing was with 100% volume in Windows.

Song Test Section are in the [Wiki](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/PA-CEQ/wiki/Songs-Tested). Tested with MP3's and FLAC off Google Play and CD Rips.

## How can I improve PA-CEQ/send you a preset for testing?
Apart from messaging me on the Poweramp forums or XDA, you can either fork this repository to your Github account, apply your settings and make a pull request or make a issue to this repository in the Issues Tab with your preset and it will be tested if there is a notice with the tested songs and your tested song.
