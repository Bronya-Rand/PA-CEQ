# PA-CEQ
Community Equalizer for PowerAmp based off the Sennheiser HD598 and Focal Utopia.

## What's PA-CEQ?
PA-CEQ or PowerAmp Community Equalizer (I call it Focal Utopia Equalizer in my place) is a community driven equalizer for PowerAmp which can also be applied to other devices and software like non-PowerAmp apps, iOS, Stock Android, and more that are equalizer capable based off 2 different headphones, the Sennheiser HD598 and Focal Utopia with no USB DAC and only a 3.5mm Jack.

## Why make PA-CEQ? You do know this was answered a long time ago on the XDA forums.
Yes. I actually used that preset before making PA-CEQ but felt something off about it. Apart from some music sounding off, I prefered a non-bass and non-treble based preset and only a dB increase or decrease and that there wasn't a estimated dB range for that XDA post so it was up to a guess to determine the EQ if it was 11.X or 12.X for different ranges and what songs that person used. PA-CEQ is actually based on the same preset with some major dB and Bass/Treble changes.

## So what is different in PA-CEQ compared to the XDA one?
What's different are the ranges and the tone. There is 0 reliance of Bass and Treble in the app and are based off the dB Equalizer in the app. Along with only dB reliance, a saved preset to transfer to other devices and visibility for other apps and OS's that don't have PowerAmp or to Windows, and car radios.

## How do I install PA-CEQ?
### For PowerAmp Users
Go to Releases and download the latest `last.poweramp-settings` file in there and drop it in the `Android/data/_com.maxmpz.audioplayer` folder. Please note this will reset your skin if you have one or theme so please re-adjust that after install.
### For Non-PowerAmp Users
Enter the Preset Screenshots folder and view the PA-CEQ screenshots in there and apply it to your Android, iOS, car radio, stereo, any equalizer set device. Please read the `Read First.md` file in the folder before configuring.

## What is your testing method for this preset?

## Hey! I have a issue with your preset and found a better setting for it. How can I suggest it to you to apply it?
Apart from messaging me on the PowerAmp forums or XDA, you can either fork this repository to your Github account, apply your settings and make a pull request or make a issue to this repository in the Issues Tab with your preset and it will be tested if there is a notice with the tested songs and your tested song.

## Will there be a PA-CEQ Bass Enabled Preset.
There will be but I really suggest to use the non-bass version first to expierence it and songs without 

## We're a record label/company and want to use PA-CEQ and apply it to our CDs or Digital Media for better quality.
PA-CEQ is GNU GPL v3 Licensed so you are free to use PA-CEQ to optimize your songs but you can't make a closed source propiertary equalizer preset that you can sell to other record labels or companies.
