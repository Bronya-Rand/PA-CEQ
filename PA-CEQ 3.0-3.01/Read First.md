### Notes
1. Poweramp/Poweramp Equalizer added the ability to export presets. You may now import PA-CEQ easily by using the export files in this folder.

2. From PA-CEQ 3.0/3.01, I added support for Parametric EQ (thanks JohnRTitor for the notice) which compacts PA-CEQ down to 6 custom bands. For non-Poweramp devices or those that prefer Graphic presets, I have replicated it back to standard bands so you can input the values within the app from the screenshot.

3. Some devices may not have all of the positions given in the screenshots. Please configure the settings that are similar or equal to the screenshots or if you are not sure, message me to add a Screenshot or TXT for your certain position.

4. While this shouldn't introduce any audio distortion anymore from what I tested, if you still get it, adjust the Preamp in Poweramp/Poweramp Equalizer or set your phone's volume to 60% to alleviate it.
