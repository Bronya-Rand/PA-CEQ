### Notes
1. Poweramp Equalizer added the ability to export presets. If you are using this and want to take advantage of PA-CEQ, you can import PA-CEQ through a given file inside the `For Poweramp Equalizer` within Poweramp Equalizer.

2. From PA-CEQ 3.0, I added support for Parametric EQ (thanks JohnRTitor for the notice) which compacts PA-CEQ down to 6 custom bands. For the regular Poweramp app, I have replicated it back to Graphic or Standard EQ so you can input the values within the app from the screenshot in the last folder.

3. Some devices may not have all of the positions given in the screenshots. Please configure the settings that are similar or equal to the screenshots or if you are not sure, message me to add a Screenshot or TXT for your certain position.

4. While this shouldn't bring any audio distortion anymore from what I tested, if you still get it, adjust the Preamp or set your phone's volume to 60% to alievate it.
